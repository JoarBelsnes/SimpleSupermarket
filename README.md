# SimpleSupermarket
I have two versions of the supermarket simulation, where one uses random for queueTime located in main branch. 
The other two is located in queue_feature and queue_feature2 branch which calculates the time arrived based on queue lenght.
These try to make the queue more simulated but fail to use timeArrived effectly enough when deciding queue times.
